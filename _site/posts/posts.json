From this dataset, a chart depicting the import and export volumes for the top 6 trading countries for the year 2019 – 2020 was generated. We have attempted a ‘makeover’ on this chart using Tableau to improve on its clarity. This post would illustrate the makeover process and cover the following sections:\r\nThe Original Visualization\r\nCritique of the Visualization to Identify Areas for Improvement\r\nSketch of Proposed Design and Comments\r\nStep-by-Step Guide to Creating the Proposed Visualization in Tableau\r\nThe Final Visualization\r\n3 Major Insights Revealed by the Final Visualization Prepared\r\nReferences\r\nThe Original Visualization\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
